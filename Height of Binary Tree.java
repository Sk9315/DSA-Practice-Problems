/*
Given the root of a binary tree, your task is to find the maximum depth of the tree.

Note: The maximum depth or height of the tree is the number of edges in the tree from the root to the deepest node.

Examples:

Input: root = [12, 8, 18, 5, 11]

Output: 2
Explanation: One of the longest path from the root(node 12) goes through node 8 to node 5, which has 2 edges.
Input: root = [1, 2, 3, 4, N, 10, 5, N, N, N, N, 6, 7]

Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path from the root(node 1) to a leaf node 6 with 3 edges.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 3*104
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 105
