/*
Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to remove a cycle if present. A cycle exists when a node's next pointer points back to a previous node, forming a loop. Internally, a variable pos denotes the index of the node where the cycle starts, but it is not passed as a parameter. The terminal will print true if a cycle is removed otherwise, it will print false.

Examples:

Input: head = 1 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The linked list looks like

A loop is present in the list, and it is removed.
Input: head = 1 -> 8 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: 

The Linked list does not contains any loop. 
Input: head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: The linked list looks like 

A loop is present in the list, and it is removed.
Constraints:
1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
